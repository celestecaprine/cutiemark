# Shebang's Cutiemark

Shebang's cutiemark has been a design conundrum for years now. Formerly, in it's highest-fidelity form, 
it was represented by a `#!` in a dark grey Fira Code, with a faint gradient on it.

While this design was able to convey the "Shebang" wordplay across, it didn't translate easily to lower-quality mediums, 
like [Pony Town](https://pony.town) or a Minecraft skin.

That's where the current design comes in. At lower resolutions, it simply appears as a hash symbol, but at higher fidelities, 
you can make out the exclamation marks that make up the symbol. It remains fairly uniform and understandable 
now matter how big or small it becomes.
